# HotTea Anti-Raid

HotTea Anti-Raid is a lightweight and customizable anti-raid system designed to protect your website from malicious activities, ensuring a secure and smooth user experience. The system employs a combination of local storage, cookies, and dynamic messages to identify and handle potential raid attempts.

## How it Works

1. **Style Customization:** The system dynamically injects custom styles into your website to display messages in a visually appealing way.

2. **User Visit Check:** It monitors user visits, checking for signs of a raid. If a raid is detected, appropriate warnings are displayed.

3. **Session and Frequency Limits:** HotTea Anti-Raid imposes limits on the number of visits and frequency of requests to prevent abuse.

4. **Animated Messages:** Messages are displayed with smooth animations using CSS keyframes.

5. **Under Attack Mode:** When an attack is detected, the system enters "Under Attack" mode, blocking requests and displaying a warning message.

6. **Logo Integration:** The "Secured by HotTea" logo is added to every message, providing a visual indication of the security system. Clicking on the logo redirects users to the HotTea repository.

## Usage

1. Include the provided JavaScript code in your website.
2. Customize the system by adjusting the styles and integrating your logo.
3. Set up the repository link in the code to direct users to your HotTea repository.
