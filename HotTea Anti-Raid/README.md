# HotTea Anti-Raid

HotTea Anti-Raid is a lightweight and customizable anti-raid system designed to protect your website from malicious activities, ensuring a secure and smooth user experience. The system employs a combination of local storage, cookies, and dynamic messages to identify and handle potential raid attempts.

## How it Works

1. **Style Customization:** The system dynamically injects custom styles into your website to display messages in a visually appealing way.

2. **User Visit Check:** It monitors user visits, checking for signs of a raid. If a raid is detected, appropriate warnings are displayed.

3. **Session and Frequency Limits:** HotTea Anti-Raid imposes limits on the number of visits and frequency of requests to prevent abuse.

4. **Animated Messages:** Messages are displayed with smooth animations using CSS keyframes.

5. **Under Attack Mode:** When an attack is detected, the system enters "Under Attack" mode, blocking requests and displaying a warning message.

6. **Logo Integration:** The "Secured by HotTea" logo is added to every message, providing a visual indication of the security system. Clicking on the logo redirects users to the HotTea repository.

## Usage

1. Include the provided JavaScript code in your website.
2. Customize the system by changing values.
